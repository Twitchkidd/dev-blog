So we created a user with our new name for the first time earlier, and that felt fantastic, I've been out with Dawa a lot, and I just tried to take him out again when he whined at me just now, and he wouldn't move, so here we are. He came and got some wuvvins when he stood up with his tail down, and then went off and chewed his chewy. I need to define what I ... I need to keep it together, between the chewing and the garbage truck going by, I'm like ... alright, now just the chewing, this we can do.

Dawa is back. He has left.

## Before Backup

- change hostname^
- case insensitivity in terminal completion^
- nvm^
- cmatrix^, the clipboard one^, yarn^, globals^
- global git config^ (username, email, defaultBranch, git new now not needed)
- terminal settings^
- Firefox^, VLC(already included!^), React Devtools^, VSCodium^ + extensions, gdebi^
- Code folder^
- Dock options (forgot to check that one I think)
- Appearance, Mouse and Keyboard settings

## After Backup

- ssh keys
- dotfiles
- Desktop background

I may find other things I want included in a backup, so I'm going to try to keep a clear log of what I do afterwards so I don't mess things up.

Okay, just need editor extensions, then backing up! To the future, though, I've been sitting for a while and haven't had a lot to eat today lol.
