Good morning!

Trying to rev my brain up, here, let's see ... Wikipedia ...

Alrighty, folks. I have played the video game in question. I have experienced the tension, the familiar patterns, and literally gasped when I hit a mine. I don't know whether it was the rendering or just my perception, it seemed like the cell with the mine revealed as red and a mine and then the smiley face changed and then all the mines appeared top to bottom and left to right ... and now I have to beat it, lol.

// Oh, it is \*much\* later. Got the sunglasses. Didn't get my time. The emulater on [the Internet Archives](https://archive.org/details/win3_Mineswee) went right to 999, and I'm pretty sure I wasn't above 500 seconds, but whatever, we can move now, holy moley. Puppy needs wuv. I'm also rethinking how much I want to make a Minesweeper clone. Which is fine. The objective of getting myself to \*sit\* \*down\* at the keyboard has been achieved, and we can take a walk and think about it, on this beautiful winter day, he types as the garbage truck does it's thing. Better than having it all pile up, though, right?

Oh no my back! Okay, Pomodoro timer, standing desk arrangement, rethinking our immediate goals, puppy. Go!
