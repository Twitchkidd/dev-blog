So, the goal here is to get the Raspberry Pi reloaded from the operating system again and to a clean reproducable state before installing Zabbix again. I'm going to take a look at what I might want to include first.

## Overclocking

Todo: I don't think I want to overclock it if I'm configuring it as a server, for longevity's sake, I want to know the details of what I was comfortable setting it to, though. I forgot where to look, leaving this as todo.

`/boot/config.txt`

force_turbo=1
over_voltage=8
arm_freq=2200

I don't know if this is standard:

\[all\]

\[pi4\]
arm_boost=1

\[all\]

## Globals

Currently:

npm:

- clipboard-cli
- corepack (?)
- npm
- pomr
- yarn

yarn:

- blitz
- create-vite
- cva
- nodemon

## VSCodium Extensions

- Auto Close Tag
- Auto Rename Tag
- Babel JavaScript
- Better Comments
- Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
- Color Highlight
- npm Intellisense
- Path Intellisense
- Prettier - Code formatter

These were disabled but looked like extensions I'd use:

- DotENV
- ES7+ React/Redux/...
- ESLint (maybe)
- GraphQL
- Live Server
- Prisma
- Python
- vscode-styled-components
